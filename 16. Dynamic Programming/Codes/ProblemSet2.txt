In bounded kanpsack we were taking decision whether we have to include that element or not, and once we take decision we do not come to that element again
In unbounded knapsack we though we have taken decision on that element we take decision again. That is multiple occurences of same item are allowed
Now take a example of icecream consider you are given certain flavours of icecream, if you disalike a flavour, then you won't take that flavoured icecream again
But when you like a flavour you will definety take that icecream again.
Hence for a ceratin element you have multiple ccurence to include it or exclude it from the set
hence if you decide that you do not have to take the element then call on n-1
and if you want to take element you will condier that element as unprocessed and hence you will take that element,then call on n
