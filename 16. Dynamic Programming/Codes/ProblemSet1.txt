FOR SOLVING RECURSIVE QUESTIONS KEEP THREE THINGS IN MIND
1. Write base condition
2. Draw choice daigram
3. Make input small

for choice problems 
That is if you are given an array then you have a choice whether to include that element then such problems are solved by this method

if you are given a weights array 
    if wt[i] < 0 -> it may be included
                 -> may notbe included
    else if it greater than wt[i], then it may not be included
