IDENTIFICATION
1. Include or exclude
2. In recursion has 2 calls then it is dp problem 
3. Optimal things are asked to do
4. Try all possible ways or count a way or find best way

STEPS
1. Try to represent problem in terms of index
2. Do all possible stuffs on that index
3. sum of all stuffs -> count all ways
   min(all stuffs) -> find min 

STEPS
1. First write the recurrence relation
2. After writing the recurrence relation store the ans in dp array
3. After storing answer in dp array we come to function and check for the base conditions after we check the base conditions we go to solve the subproblems but befre solving the subproblems what we will do is we will check whether the subroblem is already solved or not and if the subproblem is already solved then we will return it 

DP ON 2D
There are three type of questions when it comes on grids
