1. Storage
when we store int x = 57,it gets converted to binary form and then it is stored in memory and when it is retirved again it id converted to binary format 

2. numbber of bits of datatypes
byte -> 8 bits
short -> 16 bits
int -> 32 bits
long ->  64 bits

3. Range
(refer 0 to 15 representation in binary format)
in integers we have negative and positive numbers and how do we represent neagtive numbers 
if we consider the MSB torepresent negative numbers we get positive and negative 0, which is wrong and hence we cannot use this approach
Hence we find 2's complement to store negative numbers

4. Interconversion
i. Binary to decimal
    a.  first check the MSB, if MSB is 0 then it is positive directly convert it
    b. if it is 1 then, find 2's complement, add negative sign and then retrun it
ii. Decimal to binary 
    a. positive then directly convert it
    b. negative -> ignore the sign -> convert to binary and the find 2's complement
